Sure! Here are the exercises without the answers:

### Exercise 1: NumPy Array Creation
**Task:** Create a NumPy array from a Python list and print it.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Convert the list to a NumPy array
# Print the NumPy array
```

### Exercise 2: Array Operations
**Task:** Perform element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two NumPy arrays and print the results.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create two NumPy arrays
array1 = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
array2 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Perform element-wise operations
# Print the results
```

### Exercise 3: Array Slicing
**Task:** Slice a NumPy array to extract a subset of elements and print the result.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
my_array = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

# Slice the array to extract elements from index 2 to 5
# Print the sliced array
```

### Exercise 4: Array Shape and Reshape
**Task:** Create a 1D NumPy array and reshape it into a 2D array. Print the shape of the arrays before and after reshaping.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D NumPy array
my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

# Print the shape of the 1D array
# Reshape the array to 2x3
# Print the shape of the reshaped array
# Print the reshaped array
```

### Exercise 5: Array Indexing
**Task:** Access specific elements in a 2D NumPy array using indexing and print them.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D NumPy array
my_array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Access and print specific elements
# Element at (0, 0)
# Element at (1, 2)
# Element at (2, 1)
```

### Exercise 6: Basic Statistics
**Task:** Calculate and print the mean, median, and standard deviation of a NumPy array.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
my_array = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])

# Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation
# Print the results
```

### Exercise 7: Array Broadcasting
**Task:** Add a scalar value to each element in a NumPy array and print the result.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Add a scalar value to each element
# Print the result
```

### Exercise 8: Boolean Masking
**Task:** Use boolean masking to filter elements in a NumPy array that are greater than a specific value and print the result.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
my_array = np.array([5, 10, 15, 20, 25])

# Create a boolean mask for elements greater than 15
# Use the mask to filter the array
# Print the result
```

These exercises will help you get hands-on experience with NumPy, focusing on array creation, operations, slicing, reshaping, indexing, statistics, broadcasting, and boolean masking.
