### **Solution Code:**

```python
# Sentiment analysis program

# Predefined dictionary of positive and negative words
SENTIMENT_DICT = {
    "positive": ["happy", "joy", "love", "excellent", "good", "awesome", "great", "fantastic"],
    "negative": ["sad", "anger", "hate", "bad", "terrible", "awful", "horrible", "poor"]
}

def analyze_sentiment(text):
    """
    Analyzes the sentiment of the input text.

    Parameters:
        text (str): The user input text to analyze.

    Returns:
        str: The sentiment of the text (positive/negative/neutral).
    """
    text = text.lower()  # Convert to lowercase for easier comparison
    positive_count = sum(word in text for word in SENTIMENT_DICT["positive"])
    negative_count = sum(word in text for word in SENTIMENT_DICT["negative"])
    
    if positive_count > negative_count:
        return "Positive"
    elif negative_count > positive_count:
        return "Negative"
    else:
        return "Neutral"

### **Explanation:**

1. **Objective:**  
   The goal is to determine whether the user's input reflects positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

2. **Predefined Dictionary:**  
   A dictionary is used with lists of positive and negative words. This simple approach helps identify sentiment by checking the presence of these words in the user’s input.

3. **Function `analyze_sentiment`:**  
   - **Lowercase Conversion:** Converts the input text to lowercase to avoid case-sensitivity issues.
   - **Word Matching:** Compares words in the input text with the lists in the dictionary.
   - **Counting Matches:** Counts occurrences of positive and negative words.
   - **Sentiment Decision:** Determines sentiment based on the comparison of counts.

4. **Output:**  
   - If positive words outnumber negative ones, the sentiment is "Positive."
   - If negative words outnumber positive ones, the sentiment is "Negative."
   - If counts are equal, the sentiment is "Neutral."

5. **Main Function:**  
   Prompts the user for input, analyzes the sentiment using `analyze_sentiment`, and displays the result.

### **Speaker Script for Discussion:**

1. **Introduction:**  
   "For this activity, you’ll build a simple sentiment analyzer. Afterward, we’ll discuss how it could be applied in industries like marketing and customer service."

2. **Examples of Applications:**  
   - **Marketing:**  
     "Marketers can use sentiment analysis to understand customer feedback on products, campaigns, or brand reputation."
   - **Customer Service:**  
     "Customer service teams can identify dissatisfied customers early by analyzing feedback and addressing concerns proactively."

3. **Group Discussion:**  
   - "What limitations do you see in this dictionary-based approach?"  
   - "How could we make this program more sophisticated, such as incorporating machine learning?"

4. **Future Enhancements:**  
   - "A more advanced version of this tool could use Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries like NLTK or TextBlob for nuanced analysis."
   - "Machine learning models trained on labeled datasets can improve accuracy and handle more complex sentences."
