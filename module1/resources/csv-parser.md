Question:
Create a Python script that parses a CSV file containing student information and calculates the average age and average grade of all students. Below is an example of the CSV file format:

```csv
Name,Age,Grade
John Doe,18,85
Jane Smith,17,90
Michael Johnson,19,75
Emily Davis,18,92
Christopher Lee,17,80
```

Each row in the CSV file represents a student and contains fields for Name, Age, and Grade. 

Write a Python function `calculate_averages(csv_file)` that takes the filename of the CSV file as input and returns a tuple `(average_age, average_grade)` representing the calculated averages.

Ensure that your script handles CSV parsing, data conversion, and average calculation accurately and efficiently. Also, provide error handling for file reading operations and any potential issues related to data integrity.

Include instructions or explanations on how to run the Python script successfully, along with any assumptions made regarding the CSV file format.

Provide the complete Python script and any necessary sample CSV files to test the script.
