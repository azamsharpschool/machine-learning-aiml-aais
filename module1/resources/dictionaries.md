# Dictionary Activities 

1. **Dictionary Creation and Access:**
   Create a dictionary representing a person with keys for "name", "age", "gender", and "city". Access and print each piece of information.

2. **Dictionary Manipulation:**
   Given the following dictionary representing a shopping list:
   ```python
   shopping_list = {"apple": 2, "banana": 3, "orange": 1}
   ```
   Add "grapes" with a quantity of 2 to the shopping list. Then, update the quantity of bananas to 5. Finally, print the updated shopping list.

3. **Dictionary Iteration:**
   Create a dictionary representing the scores of students:
   ```python
   student_scores = {"John": 85, "Alice": 90, "Bob": 75, "Emily": 95}
   ```
   Write a loop to iterate through the dictionary and print each student's name and score.

4. **Dictionary Comprehension:**
   Given a list of numbers, create a dictionary where the keys are the numbers and the values are their squares. For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the resulting dictionary should be `{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}`.

5. **Dictionary Sorting:**
   Given a dictionary of words and their frequencies:
   ```python
   word_freq = {"apple": 3, "banana": 2, "orange": 5, "grapes": 1}
   ```
   Sort the dictionary based on the frequencies in descending order and print the sorted result.

6. **Nested Dictionaries:**
   Create a dictionary representing a library where the keys are book titles and the values are dictionaries containing information about each book (author, genre, publication year). Access and print the information for a specific book.

7. **Dictionary Merging:**
   Merge the following two dictionaries:
   ```python
   dict1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
   dict2 = {"b": 3, "c": 4}
   ```
   Update `dict1` with the contents of `dict2`, so that if there are common keys, their values are updated with the values from `dict2`, and new keys are added to `dict1`. Print the updated `dict1`.

8. **Dictionary Filtering:**
   Given a dictionary of student names and their corresponding scores:
   ```python
   student_scores = {"John": 85, "Alice": 90, "Bob": 75, "Emily": 95}
   ```
   Create a new dictionary containing only the students who scored above 80.

These exercises cover various aspects of working with dictionaries in Python, including creation, manipulation, iteration, comprehension, sorting, merging, and filtering. They are designed to reinforce understanding and proficiency with dictionary operations.
