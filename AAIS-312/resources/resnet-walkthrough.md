### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough: Using Pre-Trained ResNet50 for Image Classification**  

This walkthrough demonstrates how to **use a pre-trained ResNet50 model** from TensorFlow to classify images.

---

## **Step 1: Install Required Libraries**  
Ensure you have TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib installed.

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

---

## **Step 2: Import Necessary Libraries**  
```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50, preprocess_input, decode_predictions
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

---

## **Step 3: Load the Pre-Trained ResNet50 Model**  
We will use **ResNet50** trained on the **ImageNet** dataset. This model is capable of classifying images into **1,000 object categories**.

```python
# Load the ResNet50 model pre-trained on ImageNet
resnet_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')

# Display the model architecture
resnet_model.summary()
```

---

## **Step 4: Load and Preprocess an Image**  
We need to **load an image**, **resize** it to 224x224 (as required by ResNet50), and **convert it into a NumPy array**.

```python
# Load an image and resize it to 224x224 pixels
img_path = "cat.png"  # Ensure you have this image in the working directory
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))

# Display the image
plt.imshow(img)
plt.axis('off')  # Hide axes
plt.show()
```

---

## **Step 5: Convert Image to NumPy Array**  
Neural networks expect images in a specific format. We need to **convert the image into a NumPy array** and **reshape it** to match the modelâ€™s input shape.

```python
# Convert the image to a numpy array
img_array = image.img_to_array(img)

# Expand dimensions to match the model's expected input shape: (1, 224, 224, 3)
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)

# Preprocess the image for ResNet50
img_array = preprocess_input(img_array)
```

---

## **Step 6: Make Predictions**  
Use the **ResNet50 model** to predict the class of the image.

```python
# Make predictions
predictions = resnet_model.predict(img_array)
```

---

## **Step 7: Decode and Display Predictions**  
ResNet50 returns **1,000 class probabilities**. We will **decode** these predictions and print the **top 3 predictions**.

```python
# Decode the predictions
decoded_predictions = decode_predictions(predictions, top=3)[0]

# Print the top 3 predictions
for i, (imagenet_id, label, score) in enumerate(decoded_predictions):
    print(f"{i + 1}: {label} ({score * 100:.2f}%)")
```

**Example Output:**
```
1: Egyptian_cat (69.32%)
2: tabby (13.40%)
3: tiger_cat (3.95%)
```
This means the model is **69.32% confident** that the image is an **Egyptian cat**.

## **Next Steps**
- **Try different images** and see how the model performs.
- **Fine-tune the model** by adding new layers on top of ResNet50.
- **Deploy the model** using Flask or FastAPI for real-time image classification.
- **Experiment with other pre-trained models** like **VGG16** or **EfficientNet**.
