### Simplest Walkthrough to Introduce CNNs

This walkthrough introduces Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the simplest way possible, focusing on how they work and why they are effective for image classification.

---

### **Objective**
We will build a basic CNN using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images from the **MNIST dataset** (handwritten digits). This example will focus on understanding the role of convolutional layers and pooling layers.

---

### **Steps**

#### **Step 1: Install TensorFlow**
If you donâ€™t have TensorFlow installed, use the following command:
```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

---

#### **Step 2: Import Libraries**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
```

---

#### **Step 3: Load and Prepare the Dataset**
The **MNIST dataset** contains grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels) and their labels (0-9).
```python
# Load the dataset
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Reshape the data to include a channel dimension (required for CNNs)
X_train = X_train.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1)  # Add channel for grayscale
X_test = X_test.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1)

# Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1
X_train = X_train / 255.0
X_test = X_test / 255.0

# One-hot encode the labels
y_train = to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test, 10)
```

---

#### **Step 4: Build the CNN**
A basic CNN consists of:
1. **Convolutional Layer:** Extracts features from the input image.
2. **Pooling Layer:** Reduces the size of feature maps.
3. **Fully Connected Layer:** Makes predictions based on the extracted features.

```python
# Build the CNN
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),  # Convolutional layer
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),  # Pooling layer
    Flatten(),  # Flatten the feature maps
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),  # Fully connected layer
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Output layer for 10 classes
])
```

---

#### **Step 5: Compile the Model**
Set up the model with:
- **Optimizer:** Adam, which adjusts weights efficiently.
- **Loss Function:** Categorical crossentropy for multi-class classification.
- **Metric:** Accuracy to evaluate performance.

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

---

#### **Step 6: Train the Model**
Train the CNN using the training data for 5 epochs (iterations over the dataset).
```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, validation_split=0.2)
```

---

#### **Step 7: Evaluate the Model**
Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset to see its accuracy.
```python
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

---

#### **Step 8: Make Predictions**
Use the model to make predictions on new images.
```python
# Predict the class of a single image
import numpy as np
predicted_class = np.argmax(model.predict(X_test[0:1]))
print(f"Predicted Class: {predicted_class}")
```

from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Step 1: Load and Prepare Data
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
X_train = X_train.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1) / 255.0
X_test = X_test.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1) / 255.0
y_train = to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test, 10)

# Step 2: Build the CNN

    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),

# Step 4: Train the Model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, validation_split=0.2)

# Step 5: Evaluate the Model
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

# Step 6: Make Predictions
predicted_class = np.argmax(model.predict(X_test[0:1]))
print(f"Predicted Class: {predicted_class}")
```
