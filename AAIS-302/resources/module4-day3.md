## 📘 **Title:** Predicting House Prices Using Regression

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

Learn how to apply **regression techniques** to predict house prices based on multiple features such as size, bedrooms, age, and location. You'll walk away understanding how to:

* Load and prepare data
* Train a regression model
* Evaluate its performance
* Visualize results and draw real-world insights

---

## 🏘️ **Scenario**

You're working with a real estate agency that wants to **estimate home prices** for new listings based on past sales. Using historical data, your goal is to build a model that helps sellers price their homes competitively and assists buyers in identifying good deals.

---

## 🗂️ **Dataset Description**

The dataset includes:

| Feature    | Description                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| `Size`     | House size in square feet      |
| `Bedrooms` | Number of bedrooms             |
| `Age`      | Age of the house in years      |
| `Location` | Area/location code (numerical) |
| `Price`    | Sale price of the house in USD |

**Sample Data:**

| Size (sq. ft.) | Bedrooms | Age | Location | Price (\$) |
| -------------- | -------- | --- | -------- | ---------- |
| 1500           | 3        | 10  | 1        | 300,000    |
| 2000           | 4        | 5   | 2        | 400,000    |
| 2500           | 3        | 20  | 1        | 350,000    |
| ...            | ...      | ... | ...      | ...        |

## 🧪 **Step 1: Data Preparation**

### 1.1 Load the Data

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample dataset
data = {
    'Size': [1500, 2000, 2500, 1800, 2200],
    'Bedrooms': [3, 4, 3, 2, 4],
    'Age': [10, 5, 20, 15, 7],
    'Location': [1, 2, 1, 2, 3],
    'Price': [300000, 400000, 350000, 280000, 420000]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df.head())
```

---

### 1.2 Split Features and Target

```python
X = df[['Size', 'Bedrooms', 'Age', 'Location']]
y = df['Price']
```

---

### 1.3 Optional: Normalize Data

If your dataset includes features on very different scales (e.g., `Size` in thousands and `Age` in single digits), consider normalization:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

---

## 🔍 **Step 2: Train a Linear Regression Model**

### 2.1 Train-Test Split

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### 2.2 Fit the Model

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

---

### 2.3 Make Predictions

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Predicted Prices:", y_pred)
```

---

## 📊 **Step 3: Evaluate the Model**

### 3.1 Calculate Performance Metrics

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score

mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ${mae:.2f}")
print(f"R-squared: {r2:.2f}")
```

* **MAE** shows average prediction error.
* **R²** indicates how well the model explains price variability.

---

## 📈 **Step 4: Visualize Results**

### 4.1 Scatter Plot

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred)
plt.xlabel("Actual Price")
plt.ylabel("Predicted Price")
plt.title("Actual vs Predicted House Prices")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

✅ A tight diagonal cluster = good predictions
❌ Wide spread = weak model

---

## 💬 **Step 5: Real-World Applications**

### 📌 Use Cases in Real Estate

* Setting listing prices based on features
* Spotting overpriced or undervalued homes
* Helping buyers set realistic expectations

---

### 🚀 Ways to Improve the Model

* Add features like:

  * Distance to downtown
  * Crime rate in the area
  * School ratings

* Try different models:

  * **Polynomial Regression** for non-linear patterns
  * **Decision Trees or Random Forest** for better accuracy

---

### ⚠️ Practical Considerations

* Clean outliers (e.g., \$1M house in low-income area)
* Encode categorical variables if present (e.g., neighborhood names)
* Avoid **data leakage** (don’t use future info for predictions)

---

## 🧠 **Outcome**

By the end of this walkthrough, learners will be able to:

✅ Understand how to use regression for prediction
✅ Train, test, and evaluate a linear regression model
✅ Apply the concept to real-world scenarios
✅ Visualize performance to interpret results
