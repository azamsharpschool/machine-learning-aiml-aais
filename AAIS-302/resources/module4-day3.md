**Title:** Predicting House Prices Using Regression

---

### **Objective:**  
Use regression techniques to predict house prices based on features like the size of the house, number of bedrooms, and location. This exercise demonstrates how regression can model relationships between variables and predict continuous outcomes.

---

### **Scenario:**  
A real estate agency wants to estimate the selling price of houses based on historical data. This information will help clients set realistic prices and guide buyers in making informed decisions.

---

### **Dataset Description:**
The dataset contains information about houses, including:  
- **Size (in square feet)**  
- **Number of Bedrooms**  
- **Age of the House (in years)**  
- **Location (encoded numerically)**  
- **Price (in dollars)**  

Example data:

| **Size (sq. ft.)** | **Bedrooms** | **Age (years)** | **Location** | **Price ($)**  |
|--------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1500               | 3            | 10              | 1            | 300,000       |
| 2000               | 4            | 5               | 2            | 400,000       |
| 2500               | 3            | 20              | 1            | 350,000       |
| ...                | ...          | ...             | ...          | ...           |

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

---

#### **Step 1: Data Preparation**

1. **Load and Inspect the Data:**  
   Use Python to load the dataset.  
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   
   # Example data
   data = {
       'Size': [1500, 2000, 2500, 1800, 2200],
       'Bedrooms': [3, 4, 3, 2, 4],
       'Age': [10, 5, 20, 15, 7],
       'Location': [1, 2, 1, 2, 3],
       'Price': [300000, 400000, 350000, 280000, 420000]
   }
   df = pd.DataFrame(data)
   print(df)
   ```

2. **Split the Data:**  
   Divide the dataset into features (`X`) and target variable (`y`):  
   ```python
   X = df[['Size', 'Bedrooms', 'Age', 'Location']]
   y = df['Price']
   ```

3. **Normalize or Scale Features (if needed):**  
   Use normalization techniques if the feature scales vary significantly.

#### **Step 2: Apply Regression**

1. **Import Linear Regression Model:**  
   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   
   # Split data into training and testing sets
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   
   # Create and train the model
   model = LinearRegression()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

2. **Predict House Prices:**  
   Use the model to predict prices for the test set:  
   ```python
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   print("Predicted Prices:", y_pred)
   ```

---

#### **Step 3: Evaluate the Model**

1. **Calculate Performance Metrics:**  
   Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or R-squared to evaluate the model:  
   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score
   
   # Evaluate the model
   mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
   r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
   print(f"Mean Absolute Error: {mae}")
   print(f"R-squared: {r2}")
   ```

2. **Interpret the Results:**  
   - **MAE:** Average error between predicted and actual prices.  
   - **R-squared:** Indicates how well the model explains the variance in house prices (closer to 1 is better).  

---

#### **Step 4: Visualize the Results**

1. **Compare Predicted vs. Actual Prices:**  
   Plot a scatter plot to visualize the model's accuracy:  
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   
   plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred)
   plt.xlabel("Actual Prices")
   plt.ylabel("Predicted Prices")
   plt.title("Actual vs Predicted Prices")
   plt.show()
   ```

2. **Insights:**  
   If the points lie close to a diagonal line, the model is making accurate predictions.

### **Discussion: Real-World Application**

1. **Use Cases in Real Estate:**
   - Estimating house prices for buyers and sellers.  
   - Identifying undervalued properties for investment.  

2. **Expanding the Model:**  
   Add more features like neighborhood quality, proximity to schools, or recent market trends for improved accuracy.  

3. **Practical Considerations:**  
   - Ensure data quality (e.g., remove outliers).  
   - Consider non-linear relationships or other regression techniques (e.g., polynomial regression).

- How to implement regression to predict continuous variables.  
- Evaluate a model's performance and interpret its results.  
- Understand real-world implications of using regression in fields like real estate, finance, and healthcare.
