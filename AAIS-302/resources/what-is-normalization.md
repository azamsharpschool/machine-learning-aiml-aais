# üìè What is Normalization? ‚Äì A Beginner‚Äôs Walkthrough

### üéØ **Goal:**

Understand what normalization is, why we use it, and how to apply it to real-world data to improve the performance of machine learning models.

---

## üß† What is Normalization?

**Normalization** is the process of **scaling numeric data** so that it falls within a specific range ‚Äî usually between 0 and 1 ‚Äî without changing the shape or relationship of the data.

It helps bring **all features to the same scale**, especially when they're measured in different units (like dollars vs. square footage).

> Think of normalization as giving every feature a fair chance to contribute to a model without being unfairly dominant due to its scale.

---

## üìâ Why is Normalization Important?

Some machine learning algorithms (like Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks) are **sensitive to the scale of input data**.

Without normalization:

* A feature with large values (like house size in square feet) might dominate another feature with smaller values (like number of rooms)
* Gradient descent optimization may converge slowly or inefficiently
* Distance-based models (like KNN) may give biased results

---

## üî¢ Two Common Types of Normalization

### 1. üîπ **Min-Max Scaling**

Scales the data to a **fixed range**, usually 0 to 1.

**Formula:**

```
X_scaled = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min)
```

* Pros: Keeps all data in the same range.
* Cons: Sensitive to outliers.

---

### 2. üîπ **Z-Score Standardization (Standard Scaling)**

Transforms data to have a **mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1**.

**Formula:**

```
X_scaled = (X - mean) / std
```

* Pros: Works well for normally distributed data.
* Cons: Doesn‚Äôt limit values between 0 and 1.

## üß™ Hands-On Example in Python

Let‚Äôs normalize the `Size` column in a small housing dataset.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler

# Sample dataset
data = {
    'Size': [800, 1000, 1200, 1500, 1800],
    'Price': [200000, 250000, 280000, 320000, 360000]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Min-Max Scaling
min_max = MinMaxScaler()
df['Size_MinMax'] = min_max.fit_transform(df[['Size']])

# Z-Score Standardization
z_score = StandardScaler()
df['Size_ZScore'] = z_score.fit_transform(df[['Size']])

print(df)
```

## üìä Output (Example)

| Size | Price  | Size\_MinMax | Size\_ZScore |
| ---- | ------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| 800  | 200000 | 0.00         | -1.41        |
| 1000 | 250000 | 0.25         | -0.71        |
| 1200 | 280000 | 0.50         | 0.00         |
| 1500 | 320000 | 0.875        | 0.85         |
| 1800 | 360000 | 1.00         | 1.27         |

## üß† When to Use Each Type

| Use Case                          | Recommended Scaling       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Data needs to be in \[0, 1] range | Min-Max Scaling           |
| Data has outliers                 | Z-Score (less sensitive)  |
| Required by model (e.g. KNN, NN)  | Either, depending on data |

* Try visualizing before/after histograms using `matplotlib`
* Experiment with normalization on skewed data

## üéì Summary

| Concept       | Meaning                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Normalization | Scaling data to a smaller range or standardized form   |
| Min-Max       | Scales data to \[0, 1] range                           |
| Z-Score       | Centers data to mean = 0 and std = 1                   |
| Importance    | Ensures fair contribution of features in ML algorithms |
