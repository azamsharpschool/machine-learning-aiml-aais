**Assignment: Analyzing Car Sales Data**

**Introduction:**
In this assignment, you'll work with a dataset containing information about car sales. The dataset includes details such as the car's name, manufacturing year, mileage, and price. You'll utilize Pandas in Python to perform data exploration, cleaning, manipulation, and analysis tasks to gain insights into the car sales data.

**Dataset Description:**
The dataset consists of the following columns:
- Name: The name of the car model.
- Year: The manufacturing year of the car.
- Miles: The mileage of the car.
- Price: The price of the car.

**Assignment Tasks:**

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
    - Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
    - Display basic information about the dataset, such as the number of rows and columns, data types, and the first few rows.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
    - Check for any missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately.
    - Ensure data consistency and correctness (e.g., check for outliers or erroneous entries).

3. **Data Manipulation:**
    - Calculate the average mileage and price of the cars.
    - Group the data by car name and calculate the average price for each car model.
    - Determine the total number of cars manufactured in each year.

4. **Data Analysis:**
    - Visualize the distribution of car prices using a histogram.
    - Explore the relationship between mileage and price using a scatter plot.
    - Analyze the trend of car sales over the years using a line plot.

5. **Conclusion:**
    - Write a brief conclusion summarizing your findings and insights gained from the analysis of the car sales data.

**Submission:**
- Write Python code to accomplish each task, ensuring clarity and correctness.
- Include comments in your code to explain the steps and any assumptions made.
- Submit your code along with any visualizations generated and the conclusions drawn from the analysis.

**Note:**
- Take your time to understand the dataset and complete each task thoroughly.
- Feel free to explore additional analysis techniques or visualizations beyond the specified tasks.
- If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.
