### Walkthrough: Real-World Scenario for Outlier Detection

---

#### **Title:** Detecting Outliers in House Prices  

**Objective:**  
Identify and visualize outliers in a dataset of house prices to understand their impact on analysis and decision-making.

---

### **Real-World Context**

In real estate, some properties have extremely high or low prices compared to the average. These outliers can skew data analysis, such as predicting prices or assessing market trends. Detecting these anomalies helps refine predictions and provide better insights for buyers and sellers.

---

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

---

#### **Step 1: Load the Dataset**
- Use a dataset containing house prices with features like `Area`, `Number of Rooms`, and `Price`.  

**Example Code:**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample dataset
data = {
    'Area': [1200, 1500, 1700, 2000, 5000, 1400, 1600, 1800, 3000, 10000],
    'Price': [300000, 350000, 400000, 450000, 900000, 320000, 370000, 420000, 600000, 2000000]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display the dataset
print(df)
```

---

#### **Step 2: Visualize the Data**
- Create a scatter plot to visually identify potential outliers.  
- Plot `Area` (x-axis) against `Price` (y-axis).

**Example Code:**
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Scatter plot
plt.scatter(df['Area'], df['Price'], color='blue', s=50)
plt.title('House Prices vs. Area')
plt.xlabel('Area (sq ft)')
plt.ylabel('Price (USD)')
plt.show()
```

**Observation:**  
- Points with very large `Area` and `Price` values (e.g., `Area=10000`, `Price=2000000`) stand out as potential outliers.

---

#### **Step 3: Implement Isolation Forest for Outlier Detection**
- Use the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect outliers programmatically.

**Example Code:**
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

# Apply Isolation Forest
iso_forest = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1, random_state=42)
df['Anomaly'] = iso_forest.fit_predict(df[['Area', 'Price']])

# Separate normal points and outliers
normal = df[df['Anomaly'] == 1]
outliers = df[df['Anomaly'] == -1]

# Plot results
plt.scatter(normal['Area'], normal['Price'], color='blue', label='Normal', s=50)
plt.scatter(outliers['Area'], outliers['Price'], color='red', label='Outliers', s=50)
plt.title('Outlier Detection with Isolation Forest')
plt.xlabel('Area (sq ft)')
plt.ylabel('Price (USD)')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

**Observation:**  
- Outliers are highlighted in red.  
- Discuss why these points are classified as anomalies (e.g., significantly higher/lower price for the given area).

---

#### **Step 4: Discuss the Importance of Detecting Outliers**
- **Impact of Outliers:**  
  - Skew analysis results, affecting price predictions or market insights.  
  - Mislead buyers or sellers about market trends.  
- **Applications in Real Estate:**  
  - Refining predictive models for fair pricing.  
  - Identifying luxury properties or unusual deals for targeted marketing.

---

#### **Step 5: Remove Outliers**
- Filter the dataset to exclude detected outliers, preparing it for further analysis.

**Example Code:**
```python
# Remove outliers
cleaned_data = df[df['Anomaly'] == 1].drop(columns='Anomaly')
print(cleaned_data)
```

---

### **Discussion Questions**

1. What are the risks of ignoring outliers in real estate or other industries?  
2. Can outliers ever provide valuable insights instead of being removed?  
3. How does the percentage of contamination in Isolation Forest affect results?  

---

### **Outcome**
By completing this activity, students will:  
- Visually and programmatically detect outliers.  
- Understand the importance of addressing outliers in real-world datasets.  
- Prepare clean data for accurate analysis and predictions.  

**Real-World Extension:** Apply similar techniques to other fields like fraud detection (e.g., unusual financial transactions) or quality control (e.g., defective products in manufacturing).
