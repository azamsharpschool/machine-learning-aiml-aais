**Predicting Real Estate Prices**

**Assignment Overview:**
In this assignment, you'll work with linear regression in Python using the scikit-learn library. Linear regression is a foundational technique in machine learning for modeling the relationship between variables. You'll load a dataset, prepare the data, train a linear regression model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions.

**Assignment Structure:**

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
    - Load the dataset [Boston Home Prices](boston-home-prices.csv)
    - Explore the dataset by displaying basic statistics and visualizing features and the target variable.

2. **Data Preparation:**
    - Split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y).
    - Further split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()`.

3. **Model Training:**
    - Import `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn.
    - Create a Linear Regression model object (`LinearRegression()`).
    - Train the model using the training data (`fit()` method).

4. **Model Evaluation:**
    - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.
    - Calculate mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared using appropriate functions from `sklearn.metrics`.
    - Visualize the model's performance by plotting actual vs. predicted values.

5. **Prediction:**
    - Make predictions on new data (you can use a subset of the original data or synthetic data).

6. **Conclusion and Submission:**
    - Write a brief conclusion summarizing your findings and discussing the performance of the linear regression model.
    - Submit your code along with the results.

**Note:**
- Focus on understanding each step and interpreting the results effectively.
- Take your time to complete the assignment at your own pace.
- If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, feel free to ask for clarification or assistance.
