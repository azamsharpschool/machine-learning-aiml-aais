**Assignment: Exploring Logistic Regression**

**Objective:**
In this assignment, you'll delve into the logistic regression algorithm, a fundamental technique in binary classification. You'll implement logistic regression from scratch, apply it to a real-world dataset, and evaluate its performance.

**Dataset Description:**
For this assignment, you'll use the "Adult Income" dataset, which contains information about individuals' demographic and employment-related attributes, along with their income level (whether it exceeds $50K per year or not).

You can download the "Adult Income" dataset from the following link: [Adult Income Dataset](adult-income-dataset.csv)

**Assignment Tasks:**

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
    - Load the Adult Income dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
    - Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
    - Check for any missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately.
    - Display summary statistics of the dataset to gain insights into the feature distributions.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Handle missing values in the dataset by imputing or dropping them.
    - Encode categorical variables into numerical values (if applicable).
    - Split the data into features (X) and target labels (y), with "income level" as the target variable.
    - Encode the target variable into binary values (e.g., 0 for income <= $50K, 1 for income > $50K).
    - Split the data into training and testing sets using an appropriate ratio (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

3. **Logistic Regression Implementation:**
    - Implement the logistic regression algorithm from scratch.
    - Define a function that takes the training data, testing data, learning rate, and number of iterations as inputs and returns the learned parameters (coefficients) of the logistic regression model.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    - Use your implemented logistic regression algorithm to train the model on the training data.
    - Evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model on the testing data using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
    - Compare the performance of your implemented logistic regression model with a logistic regression model from scikit-learn.

5. **Model Interpretation:**
    - Interpret the learned parameters (coefficients) of the logistic regression model to understand their influence on the income level.
    - Visualize the coefficients using a bar plot or heatmap to highlight the most influential features.

6. **Conclusion:**
    - Write a brief conclusion summarizing your findings from implementing and evaluating the logistic regression model.
    - Discuss any insights gained and potential areas for further exploration.

**Submission:**
- Write Python code to accomplish each task, ensuring clarity and correctness.
- Include comments in your code to explain the steps and any assumptions made.
- Submit your code along with any visualizations generated and the conclusions drawn from the analysis.

**Note:**
- Take your time to understand the logistic regression algorithm and implement it correctly.
- Test your implementation with different learning rates and regularization parameters to understand their effects on performance.
- If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.
