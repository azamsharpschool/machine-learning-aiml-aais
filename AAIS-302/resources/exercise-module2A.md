**Assignment: Exploring SQL Queries in Relational Databases**

**Introduction:**
In this assignment, you'll dive into SQL queries in relational databases, covering simple queries, aggregate functions, join queries, and subqueries. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for managing and querying structured data. You'll work with a sample database representing a digital media store and create tables to practice writing SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.

**Assignment Tasks:**

1. **Data Setup:**
    - Design and create tables to represent the following entities:
        - Customers
        - Orders
        - Products
        - Categories
    - Define appropriate columns for each table based on the provided information (e.g., CustomerID, ProductName, OrderDate).
    - Set up relationships between tables using foreign keys.

2. **Data Insertion:**
    - Insert sample data into each table to populate the database.
    - Ensure that each table has sufficient data to perform meaningful queries.

3. **Simple Queries:**
    - Write SQL queries to retrieve the following information:
        - List all customers from the "Customers" table.
        - Retrieve the details of a specific product from the "Products" table.
        - Display all orders placed by a particular customer.
        - Get the total number of products in the database.

4. **Aggregate Functions:**
    - Use aggregate functions to answer the following questions:
        - Calculate the total revenue generated from orders.
        - Find the average price of products.
        - Determine the total quantity of products sold.

5. **Join Queries:**
    - Write SQL queries involving joins to combine data from multiple tables:
        - Retrieve the details of each order along with the customer who placed it.
        - Display the product name, category, and price for each product in the database.
        - Get the total revenue generated from each category.

6. **Subqueries:**
    - Utilize subqueries to perform more complex data retrieval tasks:
        - Find the customers who have placed orders for products in a specific category.
        - Identify the products with a price higher than the average price.

7. **Conclusion and Submission:**
    - Write a brief conclusion summarizing your experience and key learnings from working with SQL queries.
    - Submit your SQL script containing table creation, data insertion, and all the queries written for the assignment.

**Running Queries:**
You can use online SQL compilers such as [MyCompiler](https://www.mycompiler.io/new/sql) to run your queries and test your SQL script.

**Note:**
- Take your time to design the database schema and write SQL queries effectively.
- Ensure your queries are well-commented and organized for clarity.
- If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, feel free to consult SQL documentation or ask for assistance.
