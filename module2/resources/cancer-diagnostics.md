# Logistic Regression - Cancer Diagnostics 

In this activity you are going to use LinearRegression to find if the patient has cancer or not. 

Make sure to use train_test_split to split your data into training and testing datasets. 

You will also need to use one hot encoding to convert the "Gender" column into 1 or 0 depending on the value.
