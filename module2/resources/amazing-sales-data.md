### Real-World Exercise: Analyzing Sales Data

#### Dataset
Use a sample sales dataset with the following structure:
- `Date`: Date of the sale
- `Region`: Region where the sale was made
- `Product`: Product sold
- `Quantity`: Quantity sold
- `Price`: Price per unit

[Sales Dataset](sales-data.csv)

#### Task Overview
1. Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Perform basic data exploration and cleaning.
3. Visualize sales trends over time.
4. Compare sales performance across different regions and products.
5. Perform advanced analysis and visualization.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Load the Dataset

#### Task:
1. Load the dataset from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Display the first few rows of the dataset.

### Step 2: Basic Data Exploration

#### Task:
1. Check the data types of the columns in the dataset.
2. Get a summary of the dataset, including the number of missing values.
3. Display basic statistics of the dataset.

### Step 3: Data Cleaning

#### Task:
1. Handle any missing values in the dataset.
2. Convert the 'Date' column to datetime format.

### Step 4: Visualizing Sales Trends Over Time

#### Task:
1. Create a new column 'Total Sales' by multiplying 'Quantity' by 'Price'.
2. Create a line plot showing the total sales over time.
3. Label the x-axis as "Date" and the y-axis as "Total Sales".
4. Add a title "Total Sales Over Time".

### Step 5: Comparing Sales Performance Across Regions and Products

#### Task:
1. Group the data by 'Region' and 'Product' and calculate the total sales for each group.
2. Create bar plots to compare the total sales across different regions and products.
3. Add labels, titles, and legends to the plots.

### Step 6: Advanced Analysis and Visualization

#### Task:
1. Calculate the monthly sales for each region.
2. Create a line plot showing the monthly sales trends for different regions.
3. Highlight the region with the highest sales in a specific month with annotations.
