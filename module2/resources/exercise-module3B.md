**Assignment: Exploring Machine Learning with Pandas and Matplotlib**

**Objective:**
In this assignment, you'll work with a real-world dataset to perform data exploration, preprocessing, and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib. Additionally, you'll build a simple machine learning model to predict a target variable based on the dataset features.

**Dataset Description:**
For this assignment, you'll use the "Heart Disease UCI" dataset, which contains information about patients with heart disease. The dataset includes features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, maximum heart rate, and whether the patient has heart disease or not.

You can download the "Heart Disease UCI" dataset from the following link: [Heart Disease Dataset](heart-disease.csv)

Once you download the dataset, you can use it for the assignment tasks mentioned earlier. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to ask!

**Assignment Tasks:**

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
    - Load the Heart Disease dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
    - Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
    - Check for any missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately.
    - Display summary statistics of the dataset to gain insights into the feature distributions.

2. **Data Visualization:**
    - Create visualizations to explore the relationships between different features and the target variable (presence of heart disease).
    - Use bar plots to visualize the distribution of categorical features such as sex and chest pain type for patients with and without heart disease.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Handle missing values in the dataset by imputing or dropping them.
    - Split the data into features (X) and target labels (y), with "presence of heart disease" as the target variable.
    - Split the data into training and testing sets using an appropriate ratio (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

4. **Model Building:**
    - Choose a machine learning model suitable for classification tasks (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine).
    - Train the chosen model on the training data.
    - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

5. **Model Evaluation and Visualization:**
    - Visualize the model's performance using a confusion matrix to understand the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.
