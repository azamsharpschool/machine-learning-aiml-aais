# MatplotLib Exercises 

### Exercise 1: Basic Line Plot with DataFrame

Task:

Create a DataFrame with two columns: 'x' ranging from 0 to 10 and 'y' as the square of 'x'.

Create a line plot of 'x' vs 'y' using Matplotlib.

Label the x-axis as "X values" and the y-axis as "Y values".
Add a title "Simple Line Plot".


### Exercise 2: Scatter Plot with DataFrame

Task:
Create a DataFrame with two columns: 'x' as random numbers between 0 and 10, and 'y' as random numbers between 0 and 100.

Create a scatter plot of 'x' vs 'y' using Matplotlib.

Label the x-axis as "X values" and the y-axis as "Y values".

Add a title "Random Scatter Plot".
