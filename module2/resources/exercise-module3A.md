**Assignment: Exploring Machine Learning with Pandas and Matplotlib**

**Objective:**
In this assignment, you'll work with a real-world dataset to perform data exploration, preprocessing, and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib. Additionally, you'll build a simple machine learning model to predict home prices based on the dataset features.

**Dataset Description:**
You'll use the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset, which contains various features related to residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The dataset includes features such as lot area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and sale price.

**Assignment Tasks:**

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
    - Load the House Prices dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
    - Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
    - Check for any missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately.
    - Display summary statistics of the dataset to gain insights into the feature distributions.

2. **Data Visualization:**
    - Create visualizations to explore the relationships between different features and the target variable (sale price).
    - Use scatter plots to visualize the relationship between sale price and other numerical features such as lot area, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.
    - Use box plots to visualize the distribution of sale price by categorical features such as neighborhood and house style.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Handle missing values in the dataset by imputing or dropping them.
    - Encode categorical variables into numerical values (e.g., one-hot encoding for categorical features).
    - Split the data into features (X) and target labels (y), with "sale price" as the target variable.
    - Split the data into training and testing sets using an appropriate ratio (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

4. **Model Building:**
    - Choose a machine learning model suitable for regression tasks (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor).
    - Train the chosen model on the training data.
    - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using appropriate regression metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared).

5. **Model Evaluation and Visualization:**
    - Visualize the predicted sale prices versus the actual sale prices on a scatter plot to assess the model's performance.
    - Plot the distribution of residuals (the differences between predicted and actual sale prices) to check for any patterns or outliers.

6. **Conclusion:**
    - Write a brief conclusion summarizing your findings from the data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
    - Discuss any insights gained and potential areas for further exploration.

**Submission:**
- Write Python code to accomplish each task, ensuring clarity and correctness.
- Include comments in your code to explain the steps and any assumptions made.
- Submit your code along with any visualizations generated and the conclusions drawn from the analysis.

**Note:**
- Take your time to understand the dataset and complete each task thoroughly.
- Feel free to explore additional analysis techniques or visualization methods beyond the specified tasks.
- If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.
