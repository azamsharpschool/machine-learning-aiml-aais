## Deep Learning for Image Classification using CNN on CIFAR-10 Dataset

### Objective:
Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch).

### Dataset:
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck). There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

### Steps:

#### 1. Data Preparation
   - Load the CIFAR-10 dataset.
   - Split into training and testing sets.

#### 2. Build the CNN Model
   - Design a CNN with:
     - Convolutional layers
     - Pooling layers (e.g., MaxPooling)
     - Fully connected (dense) layers
     - Dropout layers
   - Use ReLU activation for intermediate layers and softmax for the output layer.

#### 3. Compile the Model
   - Use categorical cross-entropy as the loss function.
   - Use the Adam optimizer.
   - Track accuracy as a metric.

#### 4. Train the Model
   - Train the CNN on the training set.
   - Validate during training to monitor performance.
   - Plot accuracy and loss over epochs.

#### 5. Evaluate the Model
   - Test the model on the test set.
   - Report accuracy and loss.
   - Generate a classification report and confusion matrix.

#### 6. Visualize Results
   - Show examples of correctly and incorrectly classified images.
   - Discuss model performance.
