Absolutely! Let's break down the **Classroom Maze Navigator** project into **very detailed, beginner-friendly steps**, with explanations, examples, and visual thinking prompts so students can build deep intuition about **MDPs and navigation**.

## 🎓 Classroom Maze Navigator – Detailed Walkthrough

---

## 🧩 Project Summary

**Objective**: Build a classroom map (or use a real one) and simulate a robot agent that navigates the room to reach a **charging station**, while avoiding **obstacles** and minimizing **energy use**.

- **Each move** = costs energy: **-1**
- **Reaching the charger** = reward: **+10**
- **Actions**: Move up, down, left, right
- You can make the world **deterministic** (every action does exactly what you say) or **stochastic** (actions might not go exactly as planned).

## 📍 STEP 1: Design the Environment

### 🖍 Option A: Poster Paper Map (Recommended for Classrooms)

1. Take a large **grid paper** or draw a grid (e.g., 6x6 or 8x8) on poster board.
2. Mark:
   - **Start position** – where the robot begins (e.g., (0, 0))
   - **Charging station** – goal with +10 reward (e.g., (5, 5))
   - **Obstacles** – desks, chairs, etc. that the robot cannot pass through
3. You can draw the robot with a marker or use a token.

#### Example:
```
S . . O . .
. . O . . .
. . . . O .
. O . . . .
. . . . . .
. . . O . C
```

**Legend**:
- `S` = Start
- `.` = Empty
- `O` = Obstacle
- `C` = Charger

---

### 🖥 Option B: Use a Grid in Code (Python or JavaScript)

```python
grid = [
    ['S', '.', '.', 'O', '.', '.'],
    ['.', '.', 'O', '.', '.', '.'],
    ['.', '.', '.', '.', 'O', '.'],
    ['.', 'O', '.', '.', '.', '.'],
    ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],
    ['.', '.', '.', 'O', '.', 'C'],
]
```

---

## 🔍 STEP 2: Define the MDP

Let’s map this into MDP components.

### 🔄 States (S)
Each valid grid cell (x, y) is a state. For a 6x6 grid, we have up to 36 possible states, minus obstacles.

### 🎮 Actions (A)
The robot can choose one of:
- `Up`
- `Down`
- `Left`
- `Right`

We’ll represent actions as vectors:
```python
actions = {
    'up': (-1, 0),
    'down': (1, 0),
    'left': (0, -1),
    'right': (0, 1)
}
```

### 🔁 Transitions (T)
Describes how the world changes when the robot takes an action.

#### Deterministic:
- If you say "right," it moves right.
- If there's a wall or obstacle, it stays in the same spot.

#### Probabilistic (Slippery Floor):
- 80% move as expected
- 10% move in a random other direction

```python
T(s, a, s') = {
    'right': 0.8 to move right,
              0.1 to move up,
              0.1 to move down
}
```

### 🎁 Rewards (R)
- **-1** for every move (energy usage)
- **+10** for reaching charger
- **Optional:** -5 if it tries to walk into an obstacle (feedback)

### 🧮 Discount Factor (γ)
This is optional but adds realism:
- Use γ = 0.9 if using value iteration or reinforcement learning
- Encourages the robot to reach the goal sooner

## 🧠 STEP 3: Simulate the Agent

### Option A: Human Simulation (Great for Hands-On Learning)

1. Use a token or cutout to move through the grid.
2. Students take turns being the robot.
3. Keep track of the path, energy spent, and reward gained.
4. Add randomness (flip a coin for movement drift in slippery zones).

Use a **log table**:

| Step | State | Action | New State | Reward |
|------|-------|--------|-----------|--------|
| 1    | (0, 0)| right  | (0, 1)    | -1     |
| 2    | (0, 1)| down   | (1, 1)    | -1     |
| ...  | ...   | ...    | ...       | ...    |

---

### Option B: Code Simulation (Python Snippet)

```python
def move(state, action):
    x, y = state
    dx, dy = actions[action]
    new_state = (x + dx, y + dy)
    if new_state in obstacles or out_of_bounds(new_state):
        return state, -1  # stays in place
    if new_state == goal:
        return new_state, 10
    return new_state, -1
```

Add loops to simulate paths or use algorithms like **Value Iteration** to find the shortest path.

---

## 🚀 STEP 4: Extensions

### 🧊 Slippery Floors
- Add a chance the robot slips to a nearby cell.
- Use `random.choice()` in code or roll a dice in paper-based version.

### 🌑 Dark Areas
- Agent doesn’t know exactly where it is.
- Teach students **partial observability** and the idea of belief states (uncertain knowledge).

### 🔌 Energy Limits
- Robot starts with 20 energy units.
- Reaching charger before energy runs out is required.

---

## 📈 STEP 5: Analyze Policies

**Draw the optimal policy**: Use arrows to show best action from each state.

Example:
```
→ → ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓
↑ ↑ ↓ → → ↓
```

**Questions to Ask:**
- What happens if we increase the penalty for moving?
- What’s the shortest path?
- How does the agent’s behavior change in slippery zones?

## 🧠 Key Learning Outcomes

| Concept | Realization |
|--------|-------------|
| States and Actions | Grids and moves map directly to MDP concepts |
| Transitions | Deterministic = predictable, Probabilistic = uncertainty |
| Rewards | Influence the robot’s motivation and decision-making |
| Policy | A map from states to actions; the robot's brain |
| Planning vs. Reacting | Are we planning the full route or just reacting step-by-step? |
