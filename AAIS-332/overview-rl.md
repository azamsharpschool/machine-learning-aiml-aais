**Day 1: Introduction to Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**

### 1. **Overview of Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of learning where a computer program (called an "agent") learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment. The goal is to take actions that lead to rewards, kind of like playing a video game where you want to score points. The agent tries different things, learns from its mistakes, and gets better at making decisions over time.

### 2. **Key Concepts of MDPs**
A **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** is a way to model how the agent makes decisions in RL. It's like setting up the rules of a game, where:
- The **state** is what the world looks like at any moment (like the level or stage in a video game).
- The **action** is what the agent can do (e.g., moving left, right, jumping).
- The **reward** is the score or feedback the agent gets for doing something right (like collecting points or avoiding danger).
- The **transition** is how things change when the agent does something (e.g., if the agent jumps, it moves to a higher platform).

### 3. **Definition of MDPs**
MDPs help in making decisions when we don't know what will happen next. In an MDP:
- **States** tell us where the agent is right now.
- **Actions** are the choices the agent can make.
- **Rewards** tell the agent if its action was good or bad.
- **Transitions** describe how the agent moves from one state to another after making a decision.

This setup is important when the agent has to make decisions even though it can't always predict the future.

### 4. **Examples**
MDPs are used in a lot of real-world situations. Here are a few examples:
- **Robotics**: Imagine a robot trying to clean a room. It needs to decide which direction to move, and if it bumps into something, it gets negative feedback. If it finds trash, it gets positive feedback.
- **Finance**: In stock trading, an MDP could help decide when to buy or sell a stock based on the current market (state), actions (buy/sell), and rewards (profit/loss).

### 5. **Mathematical Representation of MDPs**
While the math behind MDPs can get complicated, at its core, it's about figuring out the **probability** of moving from one state to another based on the action taken. Probability helps the agent deal with uncertainty because it doesn't always know exactly what's going to happen, but it can guess based on past experiences.

For now, just think of it as a way for the agent to keep track of all the possibilities and learn which actions are best over time.

This first day introduces the basics, and we'll dive deeper in the next sessions!
